## About WezTerm colors

When I installed WezTerm for the first time I wanted to unify the looks and feel of WezTerm to the ones I was
accustomed to in iTerm, so I decided to set [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) as my color scheme.

At the moment I created my configuration file the color scheme was not correctly rendered in WezTerm, that is,
all the colors were wrong. I don't know if now is fixed, but, as a solution, I simply used the original colors of
Everforest when defining the colors in my WezTerm's configuration file. This solved the issue.
